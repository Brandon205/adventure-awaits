## Development Sprints and Process 
  ### Sprint 1 
  Our first sprint all about planning out app in detail. We spend the day thinking about the user story, planning models and how they would relate to one another, wireframing, and our backend routes. We spent some time discussing the distribution of responsibilities and Brandon volunteered to be our Git Master for the project.

  ### Sprint 2 
  We spent an entire work day completing our back end routes and models. Originally we did not include Mongoose's .id that is used with embedded elements in order to utilize a 'findById' so our routes all included many for loops, but we were able to simplify them after learning about the tool above. We verified our routes work via Postman and ended the day on a high note. 
 
  ### Sprint 3 
  Our next sprint surrounded React and creating our front end components. We spent the rest of our time incorporating the back end to our front end, integrating the React-Materialize module and styling our site. 
 
 
 
## Routes and Models

| GET | /categories | getting all categories for dropdown |
| GET | /listitems/:cName | Shows all list items for their category |
| POST | /categories | All categories for the user  |
| GET | /listitems/:id | Shows all listitems for that category |
| PUT | /listitems/:id | Updating listitems detail | 
| PUT | /profile/:id | Updates whether the adventure is or is not check off by the user | 
 
 
 
| MODEL | SCHEMA | NOTES | 
| ----- | ------ | ------------ |
| User | name, email, password, listitems | listitems is embedded within user | 
| ListItem | name, description, photo, categories |  categories is a reference | 
| Category | name | 
 
 
## Things to Note and Changes for the Future:
  Some goals for the future:  
  - 1. Linking users who have similar categories. Perhaps with the end goal of having people be able to interact depending on their interests  
  - 2. Have users add a date by which they want to finish their adventure and have a notification that the date is a certain amount of time away (ex: You wanted to 'Climb Machu Picchu' in 2 months!)   
  - 3. Reactive styling to accommodate mobile and tablet users   
  - 4. Mapbox functionality so user may mark the location of their finished adventure, or perhaps show the locations of all finished adventures on their profile page
